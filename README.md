This repository demonstrates an issue with vague error messages from the Firebase Authentication SDK.  The `firebase-auth-bug.js` file shows how an authentication failure results in a non-specific error message.  The `firebase-auth-solution.js` file provides a solution using more robust error handling and logging to help pinpoint the root cause of authentication failures.  This improved error handling can significantly reduce debugging time when dealing with Firebase Authentication issues.
